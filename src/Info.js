    question: "What is Summoner's Tavern?",
    answer:
      " You can summon an outworlder to be a member of the Tavern and your outworlder will be essential in the metaverse we are creating. The Tavern seeks to provide a space for NFT enthusiasts and digital art collectors to meet like-minded people and be a part of a community that is genuine and active. In our opinion, a successful project should excel in these aspects: Community, Artwork and Future Plans. More about how to seek to achieve these objectives will be elaborated upon in the roadmap and whitepaper on our website and discord.",

    question: "What makes this project different from other NFT projects? ",
    answer:
      "Also, it is a project designed by 4Q labs, a team of creative individuals who want to uplift artists and add value to the NFT space. Our ultimate goal is to be an incubator and help onboard budding artists into the NFT industry, where they can efficiently distribute their artwork into the hands of many collectors. However, as we are looking to build more NFT collections in the future, we understand your concerns that there may be a dilution of the value in the NFTs that are launched first. This is our top priority and concern as well and we will , to our best abilities, prevent this issue. In fact, we will make all decisions to achieve the opposite - making the first project be more valuable with time. All in all, we want this project to be a stepping stone for our future plans, as well as for it to be a genesis piece that is a cornerstone of the ecosystem that we envision.",
